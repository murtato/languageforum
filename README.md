# languageforum
The technologies used in this app are Ruby on Rails, HTML5 and CSS3.
The app can be reached on the Heroku link provided below:
    https://wdi-languageforum.herokuapp.com/

For installation instructions, follow the directions below:
    1. Run '$git clone https://github.com/murtato/languageforum.git'
    2. Run 'bundle install' to install any missing Ruby Gems that may be needed to run the file correctly on your machine
    3. Run "rake db:create" to create a database that your computer will use to host the file.
    4. Once your databases are complete, run "rake db:migrate" to migrate the file's tables and columns into your newly created database.
    5. I have included sample data in the event that the Languageforum app is empty upon opening. If there is no "Conversation" or "Post" data when you run the file, come back to this step and run "rake db:seed" to seed the database.
    6. In retrospect, maybe do step 5 before proceeding.
    7. Run "rails s" after you have run steps 5 and 6 and 5.
    8. Open your browser, enter "localhost:3000" into your address bar, and press 'Enter'.
    9. The app should now be fully open to your use! Enjoy!

More features coming soon!
